  Type: Directory
  CP3G MASC Analytics Contents: 
    -> ModuleInputHandler.m
    -> ModuleOutputHandler.m
  User-Contributed Contents:
    -> In this directory, users shall modify ModuleInputHandler and ModuleOutputHandler
       to accomodate any new modules. See the functions themselves for detailed
       documentation of their purpose.
    -> In addition, users can put any functions they use to abstract code
       from ModuleInputHandler and ModuleOutputHandler in this directory.
    --> NOTE: It is encouraged (as you will also read from the documentation)
        that you create (1) one function that will be called by ModuleInputHandler
        whenever your module is being run, and (2) one function that will be called
        by ModuleOutputHandler after your module has run.

core/
  Type: Directory
  CP3G MASC Analytics Contents: 
    -> ModuleInterface.m - Not an actual function, but gives the function definition
       template that must be followed to be accepted by ModuleRunner. That means you 
       must specify the same inputs and outputs as defined in this function.
    -> Default CP3G MASC Analytics Modules:
        a) <List default modules here>
        b) ...
  User-Contributed Contents:
    -> In this directory, users shall ONLY create functions that are to be
       standalone modules. Any necessary sub-functions for modules shall go in
       the helpers sub-directory. 

core/helpers/
  Type: Directory
  CP3G MASC Analytics Contents: 
    -> <Any helpers of default CP3G MASC Analytics modules...>
  User-Contributed Contents:
    -> In this directory, users shall ONLY create functions that are used
       by some Module(s) in the core/ directory.

ModuleRunner.m
  Type: Matlab Function
  CP3G MASC Analytics ONLY - DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
    -> This function is what acts as the controller for running a module. It calls
       the handlers when necessary to process inputs/outputs, calls the correct 
       module(s), and loops over the images specified by the user.

ModuleError.m
  Type: Matlab Function
  CP3G MASC Analytics ONLY - DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
    -> Will be used to handle or display errors from running modules.
